	My project is supposed to be a game that includes 3 levels and a boss level. The game starts with a basic menu screen that has the instructions to push the "P" key to start the game. When the game is started, ghouls use the glide function to glide to random x and y coordinates on the screen. The player controls the little ghost with arrow keys and collects tennis balls to grow his manliness to 10. When the ghost collects 10 manliness, he switches costumes into a bigger ghost which has the ability to eat all the ghouls. "Once all the ghouls are eaten, then he moves into the next level which the ghouls glide faster. When the player reaches the boss level after three levels, there is a short introduction to the boss then the boss starts shooting lasers. The ghost is now permanently the bigger ghost and shoots lasers by pressing the "S" key. Once the boss is depleted of it's HP, the win conclusion screen is shown and that ends the game.

	The main problems I had with the game is the prebuilt functions in scratch that are too slow and not very functional, particularly the glide and arrow key movement. When event "when up arrow key is pressed" is used, the game lags for a second and then executes whatever is under that block. To fix this lag, I used an if statement in a forever loop that loops if arrow keys pressed to remove the lag and have smoother control response. The glide function in scratch is not laggy, but it continues to glide to it's coordinates and then moves on with the rest of the program. To remedy this, I put a delay on the buttons to wait 2.5 seconds, but the button is shown to the players.
